# Nested Loops
# =================
# It is not advisable to use it as the first option for solving an algorithmic problem.

# Loop through the outer loop three times
for j in range(3):
    # Loop through the inner loop two times
    for k in range(2):
        # Print the values of j and k
        print(f"{j}, {k}")
