# Theory

The **theory** folder is your go-to resource for understanding Python concepts. It's divided into **basic** and **advanced** sections, helping you progress from foundational knowledge to more complex programming techniques.

## Structure

- üìÅ **basic**:
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Control Structures (if, else, loops)
  - Functions and Methods

- üìÅ **advanced**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Decorators and Generators
  - Exception Handling

## How to Use

1. Begin with the `basic` folder if you're just starting out or need a refresher on core concepts.
2. Move to the `advanced` folder once you're comfortable with the basics and want to explore more powerful Python techniques.

Each concept is accompanied by explanations and examples to clarify the theory.
